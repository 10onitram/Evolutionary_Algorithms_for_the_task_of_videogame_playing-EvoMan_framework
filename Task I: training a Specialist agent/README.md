### I Will Survive: Comparing Replacement Strategies of Evolutionary Algorithms within a Static Environment

The development of autonomous agents is relevant to many fields
of industry and is commonly achieved through Evolutionary Algorithms
(EAs). An integral part of EAs is their survivor selection
mechanism, to which there are two common approaches - **generational**
and **steady state** selection. While steady state selection
has been found more effective in dynamic environments, research
is still lacking on differences between these strategies in a static
environment. Hence, this study compared the performance of two
EAs, employing steady state and generational survival strategies
respectively, in a static game context. The findings suggest that,
contrary to expectations, both approaches have the same impact
on algorithm performance in a static environment. Implications of
these findings are discussed.
