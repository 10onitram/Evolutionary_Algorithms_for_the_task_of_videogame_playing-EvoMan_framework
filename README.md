## Evolutionary Algorithms for the task of videogame playing - EvoMan Framework

The aim of this project is develop, implement and compare Evolutionary Algorithms for the task of video game playing using a Python framework called EvoMan.
All the resources (files) needed to install/use the EvoMan framework and to start experiments are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/karinemiras/evoman_framework.git), including code, manual, and baseline paper. <br>
The framework includes the implementation of a Controller, which corresponds to a shallow 10 nodes-Neural Network, connecting inputs (data collected by some enviromental sensors) to outputs (viable actions for the player).
In this context, the trainable Agent consists of the numeric weights composing the architecture of the NN. <br>
The project is divided into two tasks:
1. **Train a Specialist Agent**: develop, implement and compare two EAs for the purpose of beating one Enemy;
2. **Train a Generalist Agent**: develop, implement and compare two EAs for the purpose of beating all 8 Enemies. <br>

Further details are explained in each folder.
