### Is less more? Comparing Scalarization and Pareto Approaches in a Multi-Objective Game Problem

The optimization of autonomous game agents for a single objective is a well-researched topic. Yet, many problems have more than one
objective. Such multi-objective problems (MOPs) are receiving increased interest from the optimisation community. We compared two
popular approaches for solving such problems, **Scalarization** and **Pareto** in a game context.
